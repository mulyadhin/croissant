    <h3>...but what is a croissant?</h3>
    <p>
      A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/, US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French:
      [kʁwasɑ̃]) is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape. It
      is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
      Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
